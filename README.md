BUGS:
Schedle!!!

- After selecting the date and time, the back button works, but the X button doesn't when choosing a room.
- Once a room is selected on the "Make Reservation!" page, the back button may or may not work. The X button should work.
- Clicking "Schedule" again may take you to the "Make Reservation" page instead of the actual schedule page. To retry, exit "Make Reservation" using the X button, then go back to the "Choose a Room" page.


Navigation Bar!!!
- Sometimes, you need to click buttons in the navigation bar twice, especially after navigating through multiple pages. The "Services" button often requires this.
